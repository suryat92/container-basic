What is Docker Hub?
Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry for storing and sharing Docker images, similar to GitHub for code. It allows users to push their custom images for others to pull and use.
Create an account at Docker Hub to share your work. Itâ€™s free and supports public repositories for collaboration.

Benefits of Docker Hub:
Access to a wide range of pre-built images for common applications (e.g., databases, web servers).
Easy collaboration by sharing custom images with peers.
Simplifies deployment by allowing you to use tested, reliable images.

Lab: Pull and Use Images from Docker Hub 
Pull an Image from Docker Hub:
Go to Docker Hub and search for an image, e.g., ubuntu.
Open a terminal or command prompt.

Run: docker pull ubuntu

This downloads the Ubuntu image from Docker Hub.

Run a Container from the Pulled Image:

Run: docker run -it ubuntu bash

This starts a new container from the Ubuntu image and opens a bash shell inside it.

You can run commands like ls, pwd to explore the Ubuntu environment.

Experiment with Another Image:
Pull another popular image, such as nginx (a web server).
Run: docker pull nginx
Then run: docker run -p 8080:80 nginx
Open a browser and go to [localhost:8080]([invalid url, do not cite]) to see the default Nginx page.
